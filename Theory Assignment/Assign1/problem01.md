Description: To convert Km/s to mph. */


## START
  INPUT km    // for storing speed in kilometer per second.
  miles = km * 2236.936
  PRINT "Speed in miles per hour is", miles
## END
## IPO 
  ### INPUT:
   input speed in kilometer per second from user and store in km variabel.
  ### PROCESSING:
   since one kilometer per second is 2236.986 miles per hour. So, we will multiple km/s entered by user by  2236.936 and store result in miles variable.
  ### OUTPUT :
   we will display result of calculation stored in miles variable in  output screen using correct unit.

## Approch to solution:
 I checked how 1km/s is to mph. So I multiplied kilo meter per hour to how much 1 kilometer is in miles per hour
